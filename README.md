# arduino-scara-robot
This project is about building and programming a **two Degrees of Freedom (2-DOF) robotic arm** capable of drawing basic shapes. The goal is to gain hands-on experience and a deeper understanding of robotic systems by integrating both hardware and software components.
# Project Objectives

- Build a simple robotic arm with **lightweight**, **robust**, and **precise** structure.
- Use **Arduino** to control the movement of the arm.
- Implement algorithms to allow the arm to draw basic shapes (e.g. line, square, circle).
- Explore the fundamentals of **inverse kinematics** and motion planning.

# Key Concepts

- **2-DOF Kinematics**: Understanding how to move a 2-joint arm to a target position
- **Servo Calibration**: Ensuring smooth and accurate motion
- **Precision Control**: Drawing recognizable shapes with repeatability
